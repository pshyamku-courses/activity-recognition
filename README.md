# activity-recognition
Create tidy dataset from activity data from UCI dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

# Downloading the dataset
The run_analysis.R script will check for a folder containing the UCI data set in the current working directory. If the data folder does not exist, the script will download the zipped file, extract it and then delete the zipped folder.
The folder name for the dataset is "UCI HAR Dataset". 
Please note - This folder is included in gitignore so changes made to it will not be tracked in this project.
